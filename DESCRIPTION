Description: Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various types of historical
    simulation. Currently plain-, age-, volatility-weighted- and filtered
    historical simulation are implemented in this package. Volatility weighting
    can be carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average model
    (EWMA) or other GARCH-type models. The methods of the package are described in 
    Gurrola-Perez, P. and Murphy, D. (2015)
