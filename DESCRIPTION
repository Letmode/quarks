Description: Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various types of historical
    simulation. Currently, plain-, aged- and volatility-weighted
    historical simulation are implemented in this package. Volatility
    weighting is carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average
    (EWMA).
