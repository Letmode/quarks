<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `quarks` is to enable the user to compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
by means of various types of historical simulation. Currently plain historical simulation as well as age-, volatility-weighted- and filtered historical simulation are implemented in `quarks`. Volatility weighting can be carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model or other GARCH-type models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of quarks from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quarks")
```

## Examples

The data set `DAX`, which is implemented in the `quarks` package, contains daily financial data of the German stock index DAX from January 2000 to December 2021 (currency in EUR). In the following examples of the (out-of-sample) one-step forecasts of the 97.5$\%$-VaR (red line) and the corresponding ES (green line) are illustrated. Exceedances are indicated by the colored circles.


```{r example, include = FALSE}
library(quarks)         # Call the package
```

```{r}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- DAX$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))
```

**Example 1 - plain historical simulation**
```{r}
results1 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, method = 'plain', nout = 250,
                     nwin = 250)
results1
```

Visualize your results with the plot method implemented in ```quarks```.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results1)
```

**Example 2 - age weighted historical simulation**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
results2 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, method = 'age', nout = 250,
                     nwin = 250)
results2
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results2)
```

---

**Example 3 - volatility weighted historical simulation - EWMA**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
results3 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'EWMA',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250)
results3
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results3)
```

---

**Example 4 - volatility weighted historical simulation - GARCH**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
results4 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250)
results4
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results4)
```

---

**Example 5 - filtered historical simulation - EWMA**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
set.seed(12345)
results5 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'EWMA',
                     method = 'fhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250, nboot = 10000)
results5
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results5)
```

---

**Example 6 - filtered historical simulation - GARCH**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
set.seed(12345)
results6 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'fhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250, nboot = 10000)
results6
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
plot(results6)
```

To further analyze these results one might apply backtesting
to assess the performance of these methods.

## Functions

In ```quarks``` six functions are available.

**Functions - version 1.0.12:**

* ```ewma```: Estimates volatility of a return series by means of an exponentially weighted moving average
* ```fhs```: Calculates univariate Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall by means of filtered historical simulation
* ```hs```: Computes Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall by means of plain and age-weighted historical simulation
* ```plop```: Profit & Loss operator function. Calculates weighted portfolio returns or losses
* ```rollcast```: Computes rolling one-step-ahead forecasts of Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall
* ```vwhs```: Calculates univariate Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall by means of volatility weighted historical simulation

For further information on each of the functions, we refer the user to the manual or the package documentation.
