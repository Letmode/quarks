# quarks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `quarks` is to enable the user to compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
by means of various types of historical simulation. Currently plain historical simulation as well as
age and volatility-weighted historical simulation is implemented in `quarks`. Volatility weighting is
carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). In future versions of `quarks` 
volatility filtering by means of GARCH-type models will be considered.

## Installation

You can install the released version of quarks from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quarks")
```

## Example 1

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. The data `DAX30` in this package
contains daily financial data of the DAX from 2000 to December 2019 (currency in EUR). In the
following examples the (out-of-sample) one-step forecasts of the 99$\%$-VaR and the corresponding ES are
computed.


```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
library(quarks)         # Call the package
```
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- DAX30$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))

n <- length(returns)
nout <- 250 # number of obs. for out-of-sample forecasting
retout <- returns[(n - nout + 1):n] # out-of-sample returns

### Example 1 - plain historical simulation 
results1 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, method = 'plain')
matplot(1:nout, cbind(-retout, results1$VaR, results1$ES),
  type = 'lll',
  xlab = 'number of out-of-sample obs.', ylab = 'losses, VaR and ES',
  main = 'Plain HS - 99% VaR and ES for the DAX30 return series'
)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
### Example 2 - age weighted historical simulation 
results2 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, method = 'age')
matplot(1:nout, cbind(-retout, results2$VaR, results2$ES),
  type = 'lll',
  xlab = 'number of out-of-sample obs.', ylab = 'losses, VaR and ES',
  main = 'Age weighted HS - 99% VaR and ES for the DAX30 return series'
)
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=12}
### Example 3 - volatility weighted historical simulation 
results3 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, method = 'vwhs')
matplot(1:nout, cbind(-retout, results3$VaR, results3$ES),
  type = 'lll',
  xlab = 'number of out-of-sample obs.', ylab = 'losses, VaR and ES',
  main = 'Vol. weighted HS - 99% VaR and ES for the DAX30 return series'
)
```

To further analyze these results one might apply various backtesting procedures (e.g. traffic light test) in order
to assess the performance of these methods.
