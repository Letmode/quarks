<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `quarks` is to enable the user to compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)
by means of various types of historical simulation. Currently plain historical simulation as well as age-, volatility-weighted- and filtered historical simulation are implemented in `quarks`. Volatility weighting can be carried out via an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model or other GARCH-type models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of quarks from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quarks")
```

## Examples

The data set `DAX`, which is implemented in the `quarks` package, contains daily financial data of the German stock index DAX from January 2000 to December 2021 (currency in EUR). In the following examples of the (out-of-sample) one-step forecasts of the 97.5$\%$-VaR (red line) and the corresponding ES (green line) are illustrated. Exceedances are indicated by the colored circles.


```{r example, include = FALSE}
library(quarks)         # Call the package
```

```{r}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- DAX$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))
```

**Example 1 - plain historical simulation**
```{r}
results1 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, method = 'plain', nout = 250,
                     nwin = 250)
results1
```

Visualize your results with the plot method implemented in ```quarks```.

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
plot(results1)
```

---

**Example 2 - age weighted historical simulation**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
results2 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, method = 'age', nout = 250,
                     nwin = 250)
results2
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
plot(results2)
```

---

**Example 3 - volatility weighted historical simulation - EWMA**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
results3 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'EWMA',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250)
results3
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
plot(results3)
```

---

**Example 4 - filtered historical simulation - GARCH**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
set.seed(12345)
results4 <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.975, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'fhs', nout = 250, nwin = 250, nboot = 10000)
results4
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
plot(results4)
```

To assess the performance of these methods one might apply backtesting.

For instance, by employing the Traffic Light Test, Coverage Tests or by means of Loss Function.

**Example 5 - Traffic Light Test**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- SP500$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))

results <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 500)
trftest(results)
```

**Example 6 - Coverage Tests**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- HSI$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))

results <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 500)
cvgtest(results, conflvl = 0.95)
```

**Example 7 - Loss Functions**
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9.5}
# Calculating the returns
prices <- FTSE100$price.close
returns <- diff(log(prices))

results <- rollcast(x = returns, p = 0.99, model = 'GARCH',
                     method = 'vwhs', nout = 250, nwin = 500)
lossfun(results)
```
